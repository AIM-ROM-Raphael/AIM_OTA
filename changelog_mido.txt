Open-GApps users: Use nano variant or lower. Higher variants (currently micro only) compatibility aren't guaranteed.

= Current issues =
- IR blaster doesn't work
- Reboot to recovery/bootloader doesn't work (will either freeze or just rebooting back to system)
- Camera is reported to be not so stable (?)
- Bootanimation freezes until boot completes and requires manual intervention to make bootanimation finishes (currently searching for possible upstream kernel culprit)
- The included kernel has broken DT2W and KeyDisabler procfs symlink that has been fixed on next CI build made after this (https://t.me/KudProjectCI/377)
